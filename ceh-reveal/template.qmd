## Slide titles are h2 headings

This slide shows the different levels of heading, from h2 (the slide title) down to h6.

### An h3 heading

#### An h4 heading

##### An h5 heading

###### An h6 heading

It looks like h4 is the smallest.


## Second slide

This sentence contains some _italicised text_, some **bold text**, some `monospace text`, and finally some [linked text](https://github.com/ukceh-rse/quarto-templates).

Now we have a code block

```python
import math

radius = 1.0
area = math.pi * radius**2
```

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

I recommend using footnotes to reference literature^[For example, [@Bender2021, page 3-5] ]


## Third slide
